How to run

- it runs CD-R or CD-ROM with this directory structure:

burned Quake II demo version:

\Q2Demo
  +- baseq2
      +- players
      +- pak0.pak

burned Quake II commercial version full install:

\Quake2
  +- baseq2
  |    +- players
  |    +- video
  |    +- pak0.pak
  |    +- scrnshot/quakeXX.pcx or scrnshot/quakeXX.tga (optional)
  +- other mod (optional)
  +- other mod (optional)
  +- games.lst (optional)

Quake II commercial version CD-ROM:

\Install\Data
          +- baseq2
               +- players
               +- video
               +- pak0.pak

dcload-ip:

same as burned image but on pc harddrive.
if quake directory is at C:\Quake2, under cygwin enviroment, 
$ mount -b 'C:\quake2' /quake2
and
$ dcload-ip -t <dreamcast ip> quake2.elf


Add mod/map/TC

I suggest you run under dcload-ip before burning.
IMPORTANT: if "gamex86.dll" exist in mod directory, it cannot run -- need recompile for dreamcast cpu.

1. Intall/Extract in Quake2 directory.
2. read it's document
3. make "games.lst" in Quake2 directory

example
--cut--
#gamename,dir,cmdline,screenshot,txt
Quake II,baseq2,,quake00.pcx,
Retaliatory Strike,lunar,+set game lunar +map drain,quake00.pcx,Strike.txt
--cut--

if cmdline is only "+set game dirname" then you can omit cmdline.
To make screenshot, "mkdir dirname/scrnshot" by hand and run under dcload-ip and press F12 on DC keyboard, or run quake2 on PC with 320x200 or 320x240 resolution.
